# SQANTISIM supplemental scripts

The code used to generate the PacBio and ONT simulated datasets, as well as the execution of the long-read transcriptome recontruction pipelines, can be found in this repository.


The directory **simulation** contains three scripts for simulating reads with SQANTISIM. The code used to simulate PacBio reads with SQANTISIM is included in the `simulate_PacBio_dataset.sh` script, while the `simulate_ONT_dataset.sh` script was designed to simulate ONT reads. The 'validation sqantisim.sh' file, on the other hand, contains the code used to validate the SQANTISIM simulation.


The scripts used to generate the various long-read reconstructed transcriptomes using different approaches and inputs are stored in the directory **reconstructed transcriptomes**.


The reference genome and annotation, as well as PacBio and ONT sequencing data, can be found in the main thesis's *Data availability* section.
